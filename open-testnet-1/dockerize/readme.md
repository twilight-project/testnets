# Twilight Blockchain Network

This repository contains Docker files necessary for setting-up and executing the Twilight blockchain network.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](architecture-open-testnet-1.jpg)

## What's Included?
- Nyks (pseudo name of the chain)
- Forkscanner (monitors Bitcoin Mainnet for forks and updates Nyks)
- BTC Oracle (Relayer between Bitcoin Mainnet and Nyks)

## What's Not Included?
- ZkOS or other VMs

## Docker Features

The Twilight docker script performs the following tasks:

- **Forkscanner**: Builds and runs the Forkscanner. This system connects to 3 Twilight's hosted Bitcoin full nodes. If you prefer to use your own Bitcoin Core nodes, please update the `forkscanner/nodes_setup.sql` file with the relevant details.
- **Storage (Postgres)**: Creates a container for Postgres with respective volume for persistent storage, creates databases, and applies schemas needed for Forscanner.
- **Nyks**: Builds and runs the Nyks chain.
- **BTC Oracle**: Builds and runs the BTC Oracle.

###  How To Run

To run Twilight, follow these steps:

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) from the specified link.

2. Make a clone of this repository.

3. Go to the `./testnets/open-testnet-1/dockerize`. This folder contains the main docker-compose.yml file

4. Select the appropriate [Processor Architecture] and [configuration] options. 
5. run the command

```bash
docker-compose up
```
This command will create docker containers, clone Twilight repositories, and then build and initialize the chain. 

6. Transfer nyks tokens to the node's user account

7. Start BTC-Oracle using the following command

```bash
    `/testnet/btc-oracle/forkoracle-go --new_wallet true`
```

#### Processor Architecture
The name of the nyks release executable file varies depending on the processor's architecture and the operating system. Please ensure that you update line 45 in the `/nyks/Dockerfile` accordingly:
1. For Linux on an Apple chipset, replace with `RUN tar -xf nyks_linux_arm64.tar.gz`.
2. For Linux on an AMD/Intel chipset, replace with `RUN tar -xf nyks_linux_amd64.tar.gz`.
3. For macOS on an Apple chipset, replace with `RUN tar -xf nyks_darwin_arm64.tar.gz`.

## Configurations

#### Nyks
Currently, the Docker container is configured to build a standalone node and create a new chain. If you wish to join an existing chain, modifications to the Dockerfile will be necessary. 
##### Instructions for joining existing network
    Make the following changes in `./testnet/open-testnet-1/nyks/Dockerfile`   
    1. Comment out the section for `single node setup`
    2. Uncomment the section for `joining existing chain`
    3. Provide the `genesis.json` and `persistent_peers.txt` for the existing chain.

##### Key Points to Consider
1. Upon initialization, the node will enter the Initial Block Download (IBD) phase. This indicates that your node has joined the chain and is currently synchronizing. During this period, BTC-Oracle cannot be run until the chain has fully caught up. 
2. Once the IBD is done, go to ./scripts/nyks_entrypoint.sh file and uncomment line 10. Then simply rerun the container using the commands 
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
```    

#### BTC Oracle
BTC-Oracle supports a builtin BTC wallet. It is mandatory to initialize a wallet while starting BTC-Oracle.
There are 3 possible ways to initialize the wallet.
1. Create a new wallet. 
```bash
    `/testnet/btc-oracle/forkoracle-go --new_wallet true`
```
BTC-Oracle creates a new wallet and return the 12 word mnemnic to the client for safekeeping. The wallet seed is encrypted and saved in `iv.txt` file.  

2. Import wallet with mnemonic. 
```bash
    `/testnet/btc-oracle/forkoracle-go --new_wallet true  --mnemonic "<12 word mnemonic>"`
```
    In this case, the client provides the 12 word mnemonic and the BTC-Oracle reconstructs the seed and keypairs from it.

3. Load wallet.
```bash 
    `/testnet/btc-oracle/forkoracle-go`
```
BTC-Oracle loads an existing wallet using the encrypted seed file `iv.txt`.  

#### Storage
The Docker container uses the following directories for persistent storage. Delete the following folders to remove all the data, 
1. /nyks/data/
2. /psql/data/

#### SSH connection to the container
A user can SSH into the container using the following commands:

1. List the active containers along with their IDs:
```bash
docker ps
```
2. Access the desired container using its ID:
```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
```
## Testing
Execute the following commands to verify the system.

1. ```curl --location 'http://<ip address>:<port>' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"method": "get_tips", "params": { "active_only": false }, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1}' ```

This will give us the current BTC chaitips from forkscanner. It will only work if forkscanner is working properly. Please note that it can take some time (approx. 10 min), since forkscanner need to process 100 historic blocks before becoming active.

2. ```curl http://localhost:26657/status ```
This will retrieve the current status for the nyks node. This contains information such as no. of peers and if the node is catching up.

3. ```docker exec -it <psql container id> psql -U forkscanner -d forkscanner ```
    ```docker exec -it <psql container id> psql -U forkscanner -d judge ```

These commands will open psql for the database Forkscanner (used by Forkscanner) and Judge (used by Btc-Oracle) respectively. Afterwards you can query the chaintips table. 
    ```select * from chaintips;```

## Join the network
You can use the following create-validator command to become a validator:

```bash
nyksd tx staking create-validator --amount=100000000nyks --pubkey=[your-pub-key] --moniker="validator-self" --chain-id=nyks --commission-rate="0.10" --commission-max-rate="0.20" --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" --min-self-delegation="1" --gas="auto" --gas-prices="0nyks" --from=validator-self --keyring-backend test
```

## Create a new network
To create a new network please refer to the docekrize/nyks/Dockerfile file. please uncomment the "new network" section and comment out the "join network" section near line 50.

## Grafana Stats
To Enable Grafana stats, please SSH into container. The configurations can be found in the following file

1. /root/.nyks/config/config.toml section "Instrumentation Configuration Options"
2. /root/.nyks/config/app.toml section "Telemetry Configuration"

here are the sample configurations to enable these

[telemetry]
service-name = ""
enabled = true
enable-hostname = true
enable-hostname-label = true
enable-service-label = true
prometheus-retention-time = 5000
global-labels = []

[instrumentation]
prometheus = true
prometheus_listen_addr = ":26660"
max_open_connections = 3
namespace = "tendermint"

Once the stats are enabled, they will be available on port 26660. you can visit this [link](https://medium.com/@ironsf/zetachain-testnet-monitoring-with-grafana-35609cd9308e) for a complete guide on how to deploy a prometheus and grafana server

`latest_sweep_tx_hash` stat is broadcasted by btc-oracle on port 2555
